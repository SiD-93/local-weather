- [ ] The OpenWeatherMap API does not seem to work when hosted on GH pages {GH is HTTPS and OWM is HTTP}.
  - [ ] Find an alternate API.
  - [ ] Figure out a workaround.
- [ ] ~~If none of the above works, try to host it elsewhere (maybe surge.sh).~~ Tried this... surge has some issues with the way it handles the relative paths generated by the `build` version of the JS file created by `create-react-app`. Not sure if this can be fixed on my side.
